            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Did you know there are as many stars in the universe as there are grains of sand on the beach? We all know about our closest star, the Sun, and can see quite a few stars in the night's sky but the universe is filled with many stars and they are as diverse as the species on Earth. Just like anything else, stars come in many colors, sizes, and they live and die. Let's explore the universe and learn about the many types of stars that affect our life and beyond.</p> <img src="https://d2v9y0dukr6mq2.cloudfront.net/video/thumbnail/N69pMl5/night-sky-stars-timelpase_ekgh5feve__F0000.png" alt="Starry Night Sky" height="300" width="600">
            <a name="Protostar"></a>
            <h3>Protostar</h3>
            <p>Protostars are the earliest stage of a star's life. Technically, it's what you have before stars are even formed. It's a contracting mass of gas collapsed down from a huge molecular cloud before nucleosynthesis begins. The Protostar stage lasts for about a hundred thousand years. Throughout it's time, gravity increases and the Protostar is forced to collapse down. </p><img src="http://cdn.sci-news.com/images/enlarge3/image_4456e-TMC1A.jpg" alt="Protostar" height="300" width="600">
            <a name="Main Sequence Star"></a>
            <h3>Main Sequence Star</h3>
            <p>Main Sequence stars are the majority in our galaxy. The star that brightens our day, the Sun, is a main sequence star. Even stars that you can view in our night's sky, such as Sirius and Vega are Main Sequence stars. Their size and brightness may vary but every Main Sequence star converts hydrogen into helium in their cores, releasing an immense amount of energy. Our Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and will only spend about 10 billion years as a Main Sequence star before it reaches it's next stage.</p><img src="https://ak9.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/7902859/thumb/1.jpg" alt="Main Sequence Star" height="300" width="600">
            <a name="Red Giant Star"></a>
            <h3>Red Giant Star</h3>
            <p>Red Giant stars are formed when a star has used up its stock of hydrogen in its core to fuel nuclear fusion. Hydrogen around the core sparking the continuation of the star's life causes the star to increase it's size tremendously compared to it's Main Sequence phase. Below, is a diagram of just how much bigger our sun could get when it becomes a Red Giant. The Red Giant star phase will only last a couple of hundred million years before it's fuel entirely runs out and expands a shell of ionized gas called a Planetary Nebula.</p><img src="https://factslegend.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sun-red-giant.jpg" alt="Red Giant Star" height="300" width="600">
            <a name="White Dwarf Star"></a>
            <h3>White Dwarf Star</h3>
            <p>A White Dwarf star forms when a star has entirely run out of hydrogen fuel in it's core. It's size decreases so drastically, many White Dwarfs sizes become similar to size of Earth. They still shine from once being a hot star but continue to cool down as a White Dwarf. This takes hundreds of billions of years so there is no evidence of actual cooled down White Dwarfs as of now and astronomers are unsure about what happens after it does become cool. </p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4CacA3Cvdkw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="White Dwarf Star" height="300" width="600">
            <a name="Supergiant Star"></a>
            <h3>Supergiant Star</h3>
            <p>Supergiant stars are the largest stars in the universe. They are enormous compared to the Sun we see each and every day and are normally blue in color causing them to be the hottest in temperature. The diagram below is an accurate depiction of just how super these Supergiants are compared to our Sun. Supergiants consume hydrogen fuel at such large rates that they tend to live fast and die young. A few million years to be exact. Unlike Red Giant stars that just expand a shell of ionized gas, Supergiants explode and destroy themselves as a Supernova.</p><img src="http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a011200/a011250/Sun-Star_Scale_Half_FINAL.jpg" alt="Supergiant Star" height="300" width="600">
            <a name="Neutron Star"></a>
            <h3>Neutron Star</h3>
            <p>Neutron Stars are the remaining core from a Supernova explosion. It's a type of star that is composed only of neurtons. The gravity of the neutron star pulverizes protons and electrons together to make neutrons. But neutron stars aren't always the final result of a Supernova. If the Supergiant was even more massive, it would become a Black Hole after the Supernova explosion.</p><img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/751988main_magnetar_art_large.jpg" alt="Neutron Star" height="300" width="600">

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Because stars are so many light years away, people aren't really aware of just how complex and amazing the lifespan of stars really are. I didn't get to dive too deep into the life cycle of all the stars but the diagram below shows a pretty good and brief example about their lives. It shows the types of stars, how they form, the many sizes and colors and the many stages each star goes through. Hopefully, this informative site makes someone appreciate stars a little more today than they did yesterday.</p><img src="http://cdn.sci-news.com/images/enlarge5/image_6805_2e-White-Dwarf-Crystals.jpg" alt="Stellar Types" height="300" width="600">
